Instructions: 
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). 
2. Slice the bread lengthwise, but not all the way through, so it remains intact. 
3. In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic, softened butter, oregano, and salt. 
4. Spread the garlic butter mixture evenly on both sides of the bread. 
5. Wrap the bread in foil and place it in the preheated oven. 
6. Bake for about 10 minutes or until the bread is crispy on the outside. 
7. Serve warm as a side with your favorite meals.
