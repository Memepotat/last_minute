Instructions: 
1. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until well combined. 
2. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly coat it with cooking spray or butter. 
3. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and let it cook for a minute or two until the edges start to set. 
4. Sprinkle the diced tomato and crumbled feta cheese evenly over one-half of the omelette. 
5. Season with salt, pepper, and fresh herbs if desired. 
6. Using a spatula, carefully flip the other half of the omelette over the filling, creating a half-moon shape. 
7. Cook for another minute or until the omelette is fully cooked through. 
8. Slide the omelette onto a plate, cut it in half if desired, and serve hot.
