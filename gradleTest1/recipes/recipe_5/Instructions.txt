Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and prepare a baking dish.
2. Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Set aside.
3. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and sauté until softened and fragrant.
4. Add the shredded chicken, cooked pasta, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, milk, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine.
5. Fill each bell pepper with the chicken and pasta mixture, pressing it down gently to fill the peppers completely.
6. Place the stuffed bell peppers in the prepared baking dish.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the filling is heated through.
8. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.
